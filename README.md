# SAFDOM
Simple as $uck DOM API shorthands. Mainly to use with latest Chromium (45+).
All other browsers compatibility notes in code are JUST FOR REFERENCE, and not all features have such notes.
It is not intended to be totally cross-browser, although tries to use only general, well-known and compatible calls.

I'm using it with my [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/) projects to get totally rid of jQuery (which is VERY SLOW and bloated for such use),
while having convinient tool for querying CSS selectors, DOM traversal and manipulations.

It does not have tests (yet) and had been published only for demonstration purposes.
Can have some dirty comments and untested code and does not ready for production use.

P.S. I know that extending core objects' prototypes is far not a 'best practice' and have some side effects,
but hey. Accept it or leave it. It's a specific thing for a specific case.
